# Bike_sharing_demand_prediction

Description:
This project involved predicting the daily demand for a bike-sharing service based on historical data. The dataset includes features such as weather conditions, temperature, holiday status, and time of the year. The aim was to build a predictive model to help bike-sharing companies allocate resources efficiently

Algorithms/Techniques Used:
Linear Regression: Used as a baseline model for demand prediction.
Random Forest: Applied to capture non-linear relationships and improve prediction accuracy.
Gradient Boosting: Further improved the model by focusing on reducing prediction errors iteratively.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Used GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.

Conclusion:
The Random Forest model emerged as the most effective in predicting bike demand with high accuracy. Weather conditions, such as temperature and humidity, along with working days, were the most significant features influencing demand. This model can help bike-sharing services manage inventory, plan maintenance, and optimize bike availability to meet customer needs.
